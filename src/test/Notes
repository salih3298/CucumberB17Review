Steps to create Framework:
1.	Add the dependencies to POM.xml
2.	Reload project.
3.	Delete main folder.
4.	Add directory recourses under TEST folder.
5.	Create config and features directories under resources.
6.	Under config create config.properties file (used for key value pair important info(url/browser/etc))
7.	Under feature folder create Login.feature file (u can name is differently)
8.	Add steps to your feature file
    (Feature: Login Feature Scenario: user enters correct credentials and is able to login
    Given user navigates to the website
    When user enters the credentials
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in)
9.	Under Java create utils, steps and runners directories
10.	Under utils create CommonMethods ConfigReader and Constants classes
11.	Add common methods that we already have in a different project to CommonMethods class
12.	Same with Constants, add them from a different project to Constants class
13.	Also add config reader code from a different project to ConfigReader class
14. Add runner class under runners directory and copy it from a different project
15. To generate step definitions set dryRun to true and run the runnerClass
16. Copy the step definitions that generated and paste them into the  â€”>
17. Create the LoginSteps class under steps directory  and paste generated definitions here
18. Start writing the java code into the generated definitions



The use of Page Factory in conjunction with Cucumber is an adoption of the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
The primary purpose of POM is to represent web pages as classes, where each web element on the page is defined as an
instance variable in that class. Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements and provides a set of
annotations to help in locating and operating on the web elements.

Here's why you might prefer using Page Factory with Cucumber over directly using driver.findElement:

Readability: By organizing web elements and related methods in a separate class (page object),
your test code becomes much cleaner and more readable. It abstracts the implementation details of the
page from the actual test cases.

Maintainability: If there's a change in the structure or design of the web page, you only need to update the
page object class instead of making changes in all the individual test cases. This centralization greatly reduces
the maintenance cost.

Reusability: Page objects can be reused across multiple test cases. You don't have to redefine or locate a web element
every time you need it in a different test.

Annotations: Page Factory provides annotations like @FindBy to make the declaration of web elements more intuitive and clean.
These annotations provide various strategies to locate elements, making the element definition more human-readable.

Lazy Initialization: Page Factory initializes web elements when they are accessed, not when they are declared.
This means your tests may run faster since unnecessary element initializations are avoided.
Method Chaining: Some implementations of Page Factory and the Page Object Model allow for method chaining, which
can result in more expressive and concise test scripts.

Consistency: Adopting a standardized design pattern across the team ensures everyone is on the same page,
making code reviews and collaborations more effective.

Enhanced Error Handling: With Page Factory and a well-implemented Page Object Model,
you can incorporate better error handling mechanisms. For instance, if an element is not found,
you can have more descriptive error messages pointing to which page and which element caused the issue.

While using driver.findElement directly might seem simpler for small projects or individual tests,
as your testing suite grows, direct element calls can make your tests harder to maintain.
Adopting Page Factory and the Page Object Model provides scalability, readability,
and maintainability advantages in the long run.


**************************************************************

The code is wrapped in a Cucumber step definition, indicated by the @When annotation, which suggests that it is used in a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework to define test scenarios.

The step definition method is named user_adds_multiple_employees_from_excel_using_and_verify_them and takes a single parameter, sheetName, which is a string representing the name of an Excel sheet.

Inside the method, the code performs the following tasks:

a. Reads data from an Excel sheet specified by the sheetName using a custom ExcelReader class and stores it in a List of Map objects. Each Map represents the data for a single employee.

b. Iterates over the list of Map objects using an Iterator to process each employee's data one at a time.

c. For each employee, it extracts data such as first name, middle name, last name, photograph, username, and password from the Map.

d. It interacts with web elements (assumed to be part of a web application) using methods like sendText, click, and getAttribute to add an employee's details and click the save button.

e. After saving an employee, it retrieves the employee's ID from the web page.

f. It clicks on an "Employee List" button on the dashboard to navigate to a page where employee information is displayed in a table.

g. It searches for the newly added employee using their ID in a search field and clicks the search button.
